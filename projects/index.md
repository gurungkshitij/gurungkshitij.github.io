Lifelong football (soccer ⚽) enthusiast (aiming for Ronaldo's longevity!🧘), fitness commander always up for a health chat 💪, and a secret singing superstar in the making. When I'm not doing that, I'm on the go for the next big bass and brook trout catch 🎣, pitching a tent to soak in those night skies 🏕️, and capturing it all with cinematic drone shots. And my Nepali chicken tarkari? It's not just food 🍳, it's a cultural experience... that might involve uncontrollable happy noises. Just try it. 😉 </font>
