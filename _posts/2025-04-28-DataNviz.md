# Introduction & Problem Definition

Weather conditions significantly influence public transportation usage, but the extent of this
impact remains understudied. In New York City‚Äîwhere millions rely on the subway daily‚Äî
understanding how factors like temperature, precipitation, and holidays affect ridership can
empower transit planners to optimize service and help commuters make informed travel
decisions. This end-to-end project integrates real world data, performs advanced data visualization and predictive modeling (machine learning), and
quantifies these relationships to predict subway ridership under varying weather conditions and holidays.

### We plan to achieve following things in this project:

- Datasets & Preprocessing

  - Our main dataset was the MTA Subway Hourly Ridership: 2020-2024 from data.ny.gov, which contains ~111 million rows and 12 columns. It includes time series data on hourly ridership at each station complex, originally broken down by payment type. By building a normalized SQLite database, we were able to reduce the dataset size from a >16 GB CSV file to a 7 GB database, aggregated by station and hour. The resulting hourly ridership values served as the dependent variable in our analysis.
  - In addition, we also incorporated the following datasets:
      - Weather ‚Üí accessed historical weather data from Open-meteo API (1,325 rows x 26 cols)
      - Federal Holidays ‚Üí sourced from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (11 rows x 2 cols)
      - School Holidays ‚Üí sourced from NYC Public Schools website (39 rows x 3 cols)

- Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineer
  - Performed Descriptive data analysis, created scatter plots, historgrams, box plots to understand the data distribution
  - Built correlation heat maps, conducted VIF analysis, and leveraged dimension reduction techniques to perform feature selection
  - Created feature engineered variables such as temperature range, temporal (consin, cyclical features), and transformed (log) skewed features suchash precipitation and snow
- Time series Analysis
  - Built autoregressive (AR) models that can then be used as a comparative benchmark for more complex models augmented with additional features, which are expected to yield superior predictive performance.
  - Decomposition revealed a weak but slightly positive trend in ridership, while both the seasonal component and autocorrelation analysis showed strong weekly cyclicality.
  - Built Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing and SARIMA, finding that both over-predicted during holidays‚Äìhighlighting the importance of incorporating holiday data to better predict ridership.
- Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning)
    - We trained many ML models (parametric and non-parametric) to capture complex real world patterns. 
      - Parametric models: Multiple Linear Regression (OLS), Regularized Regression (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) plus Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
      - Non-Parametric models: Tree based (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, CATBoost), PCA Regression
- Data Visualization
  - Developed interactive D3.js and Tableau visualizations, which is great for end-users to explore around (for EDA and descriptive analysis)
- Model Evaluation and comparison.
  - Deployed our best model (Random Forest with Temporal Feature) in Reach Web App for Inference/Prediction
- Conclusion and Results
- Build a React WebApp to consolidate our entire project
