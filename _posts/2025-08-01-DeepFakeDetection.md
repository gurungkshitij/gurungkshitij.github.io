# Introduction & Problem Definition

The spread of AI-generated media demands accessible and accurate deepfake detectors. Most research evaluates deepfake detectors on research-oriented datasets
generated by specific models or tampering techniques. Our analysis instead focuses on developing deepfake detectors for a new ‚Äúin-the-wild‚Äù benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024.
We demonstrate how the simple approach of adapting large foundation vision models pretrained on CLIP and finetuned gradually with cosine annealing produce generalizable
deepfake detectors. Our best deepfake detectors set a new standard for open-source models ‚Äì 81% accuracy onDeepfake-Eval-2024 ‚Äì outperforming previous open-source
models by 12% and closely competing with leading commercial deepfake detectors. Our approach offers tradeoffs in computational performance and interpretability, highlighting
how costly and practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in real-world settings.

### We have achieved the following in our project:

- Project Goal: Predict the 2025 Ballon d'Or winner and top 30 nominees.
- Data Acquisition: Gathered player statistics and historical records from multiple football data platforms, including FBref.com, FIFA, UEFA, and France Football.(Our raw data has 11,360 players with 117 features. )
- Data Scope: Analyzed player statistics from Europe‚Äôs top 5 leagues, World Cup, UEFA Champions League, Euro Cup and Copa America (2020-2024).
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and filtering out goalkeepers.
- Feature Engineering: Developed and normalize 117 player features, including passing, defensive, possession, and standard statistics, individual awards, team achievements, and social media reach; normalized key performance metrics per 90 minutes played and average seasonal playing time; combined statistics across tournaments using weighted strategies based on tournament prestige; and created percentage features, such as percentage of short pass completion and successful take-ons.
  - For example, if Lionel Messi played for PSG in tournaments such as Ligue1, Champions League, and World Cup during 2021-2022 season then we multipled the three rows with weights and summed them to form one row for 2021-2022 season. 'Playing Time_Min' and 'Playing Time_90s' were aggregated using sum across the tournaments rather than weighted sum because it preserves the actual playing time as the denominator for the rate statistics like ‚Äògoals_per90min‚Äô, while weighted sums of other statistics capture the impact of tournament prestige on their overall output.
  - To avoid inflation by low-minute players for per_90min_played stats, we multiplied a player‚Äôs stats with the ratio of playing time and mean season playing time if they player played less minutes than season average playing time.
- Nominees Classification Model Development: Built a classification model (using stacked ensembles of Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LGBM) to predict Ballon d'Or top 30 nominees.
  - Address Class Imbalance: Implemented SMOTE and class weighting techniques to handle the imbalance between nominees and non-nominees.
- Feature Selection: Identifed the most influential features for nominee prediction, including availability, offensive productivity, tactical involvement, and team success.
- Winner Ranking Model: Trained a regression model (PCA Regression) to rank the predicted nominees, focusing on the top 3.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like F1 score, ROC AUC, precision, recall, RMSE, and average precision at K=3.
- 2025 Prediction: Applied the trained models to the 2024-2025 season data to predict the 2025 Ballon d'Or winner and nominees.
- Result Analysis: Analyzed the model's predictions, compare them with expert opinions, and discuss the key factors influencing the 2025 Ballon d'Or outcome.
- Address Limitations: Acknowledged and discussed limitations of the model, such as bias towards attacking players and the exclusion of the 2010-2020 period.

We‚Äôve demonstrated how to finetune foundation vision models for in-the-wild deepfake detection. Specifically,
ConvNeXt and Vision Transformer architectures were pretrained using contrastive language-image pairs (CLIP) and
further finetuned on Deepfake-Eval-2024. We also show how cosine annealing and slower learning rates induced additional exploration and resulted in our most generalizable
deepfake detectors. Our models achieve 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024, a new record for open-source models.
This exceeds the previous best open-source model (69% accuracy) and closely follows the leading commercial model
(82% accuracy) as reported in the debut of Deepfake-Eval-2024. We‚Äôve also highlighted some tradeoffs these open-
source models offer in terms of size, complexity, and interpretability. These results highlight the potential of large
open-source vision models with realistic deepfake datasets. We acknowledge the great progress Deepfake-Eval-2024
makes as a new in-the-wild deepfake detection benchmark. At the same time, it is clear its small size and distribution
are challenging. While the particular collection channels and labeling methodology used to curate this dataset make
our benchmark results noteworthy, they may not necessarily represent how these deepfake detectors perform across all
real-world settings.Furthermore, the field of artificial intelligence and deepfake generation techniques is moving quickly.
It is critical to continue dedicating resources to developing newer and realistic benchmarks as well as new models to keep up with
these rapid advancements. Deepfake detection will continue to matter for maintaining the public‚Äôs vigilance of disinformation, fraud, and harassment as well as trust in media
authenticity.
