# Introduction & Problem Definition

The spread of AI-generated media demands accessible and accurate deepfake detectors. Most research evaluates deepfake detectors on research-oriented datasets
generated by specific models or tampering techniques. Our analysis instead focuses on developing deepfake detectors for a new ‚Äúin-the-wild‚Äù benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024.
We demonstrate how the simple approach of adapting large foundation vision models pretrained on CLIP and finetuned gradually with cosine annealing produce generalizable
deepfake detectors. Our best deepfake detectors set a new standard for open-source models ‚Äì 81% accuracy onDeepfake-Eval-2024 ‚Äì outperforming previous open-source
models by 12% and closely competing with leading commercial deepfake detectors. Our approach offers tradeoffs in computational performance and interpretability, highlighting
how costly and practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in real-world settings.

### We have achieved the following in our project:

- Project Goal: Predict the 2025 Ballon d'Or winner and top 30 nominees.
- Data Acquisition: Gathered player statistics and historical records from multiple football data platforms, including FBref.com, FIFA, UEFA, and France Football.(Our raw data has 11,360 players with 117 features. )
- Data Scope: Analyzed player statistics from Europe‚Äôs top 5 leagues, World Cup, UEFA Champions League, Euro Cup and Copa America (2020-2024).

We‚Äôve demonstrated how to finetune foundation vision models for in-the-wild deepfake detection. Specifically,
ConvNeXt and Vision Transformer architectures were pretrained using contrastive language-image pairs (CLIP) and
further finetuned on Deepfake-Eval-2024. We also show how cosine annealing and slower learning rates induced additional exploration and resulted in our most generalizable
deepfake detectors. Our models achieve 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024, a new record for open-source models.
This exceeds the previous best open-source model (69% accuracy) and closely follows the leading commercial model
(82% accuracy) as reported in the debut of Deepfake-Eval-2024. We‚Äôve also highlighted some tradeoffs these open-
source models offer in terms of size, complexity, and interpretability. These results highlight the potential of large
open-source vision models with realistic deepfake datasets. We acknowledge the great progress Deepfake-Eval-2024
makes as a new in-the-wild deepfake detection benchmark. At the same time, it is clear its small size and distribution
are challenging. While the particular collection channels and labeling methodology used to curate this dataset make
our benchmark results noteworthy, they may not necessarily represent how these deepfake detectors perform across all
real-world settings.Furthermore, the field of artificial intelligence and deepfake generation techniques is moving quickly.
It is critical to continue dedicating resources to developing newer and realistic benchmarks as well as new models to keep up with
these rapid advancements. Deepfake detection will continue to matter for maintaining the public‚Äôs vigilance of disinformation, fraud, and harassment as well as trust in media
authenticity.
