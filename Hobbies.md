 <center> <strong><font size="+1"> Find me playing soccer, working out, singing, cutting hair, or cooking Nepalese special chicken tarkari. </font> </strong> </center>

I love playing and watching football (soccer). I have played football pretty much my whole life and will continue to do so as long as my body can withold: atleast 50 years old (outlier &#128521;). I look up to Cristiano Ronaldo (football player), and am insipred by his hardwork, determination, and work ethic. I also enjoy working out and staying in shape. I love talking and sharing ideas about diets, various exercises techniques, body builidng, powerlifting, and learning more about our bodies. I also enjoy singing and hope to write and release my own song one day.

Similarly, I like performing on stage. I grew up being part of many dance performances, solo song concerts, and other stage shows in my boarding school (Budhanilkantha School, Nepal). Even at St. Olaf College (Northfield, MN), I was involed in multiple culutral shows, where I composed and performed Nepali dances and sang songs in an attempt to share some of my culture. Talking about culture, you have to try my special Nepali chicken tarkari (curry) because I take pride in that. &#128526; .

Here are some of my performances and involvements that I was part of. 

### Singing a nepali song during Omkara '18 (Annual cultural festial) at St. Olaf College)

### 2 years transformational video of my health and fitness journey
<font size = '0.5'> Weightlifting and fitness in general have awarded me with surprising energy and positive attitude towards life over the past two years! I can't emphasis how magical, powerful, and transformational it is. It has taught me the meanings of Aim, Hard work, Failure, Practice, Persistence, and Victory! Basically the core foundation of Life and Success!
I encourage everyone to give it a try and experience the magic. Stay healthy, stay positive, and enjoy your beautiful Life to the Fullest! Trust me! </font>
