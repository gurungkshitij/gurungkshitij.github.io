<strong> <center> I am Kshitij Gurung and welcome to my Website!</center></strong> 
I am a motivated learner with a genuine interest in data science and analytics. I throughly enjoy playing with data, discovering interesting patters, and explaining impactful stories that motivate data-driven decisions. My interests lie in the intersection of data science, health care, sports analytics, and fintech because I am Health & Fitness junkie who loves technology. Besides my professional work, you can find me speding time playing soccer, working out (powerlifting), making cover songs, hair cutting, fishing, or cooking.
