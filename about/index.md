<hr/>

Microsoft Certified Data Science & Advanced Analytics professional, currently pursing part-time Masters in Computational Data Analytics (AI/ML) at Georgia Tech University. A hardworking, versatile, and confident personality with a proven record of delivering results in fast-paced and inter-disciplinary environment through technical expertise, communicational, leadership, organizational, and critical thinking skills.
 
Four plus years of Data consultation experience, working very closely with clients (medium to large size businesses -B2B) from diverse industries and building robust enterprise-level data solutions in a wide range of data disciplines. Some of the projects that I worked at were building end-to-end Business Intelligence infrastructures, Data warehousing and ETL pipelines (Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Logic Apps, SSIS, Big Query), Data storage and management (Azure SQL Databases & Managed Instances, SQL Server, Big Query), Analytics, Reports & Visualization (Power BI, SSRS), and ML Engineering (Azure Machine Learning, MLflow, GCP, AI Platforms). My nature of work demands end-to-end project delivery with constant client interaction throughout the process. Besides working on building and delivering the project, I get involved from the initial pre-sale and business requirement gathering phase where I meet with clients to conduct Analysis & Design, pitch our products and offerings, scope out Statement of Work, BUILD the product, and finally support the clients post-project delivery.
